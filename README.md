# Pandamonium


This was a project for an optional course on Game Development Methodology during my Informatics and Computer Engineering Masters specializing in Intelligent Systems and Data Analysis and Processing at IST.

The game was developed by 4 developers from IST and 2 artists from the Fine Arts University of Lisbon. It is a platformer about Mookie, a panda that has suffered a genetic mutation as a result of the pollution caused by humans. This mutation meant that Mookie developed two personalities: The enraged one in which he became berserk and could use special abilities and deal increased amounts of damage, at the cost of reduced mobility and the calm and collected where not only was he super mobile and could explore all the possible nooks and crannies around the map but also had access to things such as X-ray vision to detect previously hidden things.

This repository includes a small demonstration of the gameplay that our group presented during the Games fair at our university
